<h1 align= "center">Unit Circle</h1>

<div align="center">
  Many Grade 11 Students feel that when they learn about the trigonometric unit circle for the first time, they find it difficult. This JS/HTML/CSS simple project presents a good visual representation of how the unit circle works.
</div>

## How it Works
- Uses cartesian-plane in HTML to relate points onto the graph
- Uses inputted angle to calculate the x and y points based on trigonmetric ratios and then scales & translates them onto a graph
- Creates labels for the length of the triangle sides created in the unit circle
